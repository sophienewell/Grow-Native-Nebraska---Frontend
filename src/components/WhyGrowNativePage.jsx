            Native plants are those that occur naturally in a region in which
            they evolved. They are the ecological basis upon which life depends,
            including birds and people. Without them and the insects that
            co-evolved with them, local birds cannot survive.

          Unfortunately, most of the landscaping plants available in nurseries
          are alien species from other countries. These exotic plants not only
          sever the food web, but many have become invasive pests, outcompeting
          native species and degrading habitat in remaining natural areas.
        </p>

          Restoring native plant habitat is vital to preserving biodiversity. By
          creating a native plant garden, each patch of habitat becomes part of
          a collective effort to nurture and sustain the living landscape for
          birds and other animals.
